            <h2>Our story</h2>
            <p>Wisdom Land Model School opened in September 2010. It grew from a vision that its founder, Dr Akojede Abiodun, received in August 1996 in Osun State. He believed a good school should bring quality education to the grassroots, at a price an average Nigerian family can afford.</p>
            <p>We began with 14 pupils and 10 staff at Lola Engineering Bus Stop, near Bells University in Ota. Our first Principal was Mr Faithful Ugorji. We were not the first school in the area, but discipline and hardworking teachers soon made us one of the most trusted.</p>
            <p>Dr Akojede brought years of experience as a head teacher and principal in Abuja, Benin, Ile-Ife, Lagos and Ota. His guiding principle is “Catch them young.” Today, more than {yearsOpen()} years on, that principle still shapes every classroom.</p>

            <p>Welcome to Wisdom Land Model School. Every child who walks through our gate carries something unique, and our work is to help them find it.</p>
            <p>We teach with firmness and with love. Pupils learn to ask good questions, to work hard, to respect others and to believe in themselves. We watch each one closely, celebrate their small steps and correct them kindly when they stray.</p>
            <p>We hope every pupil leaves us not only with excellent results, but with character, faith and the confidence to be useful to their family and society. Thank you for trusting us with your child.</p>
